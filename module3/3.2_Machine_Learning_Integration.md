# Module 3.2: Machine Learning Integration in KQL

Welcome to Module 3.2 of the KQL Explorer's Guide! In this module, we'll explore the exciting integration of machine learning with Kusto Query Language (KQL). Machine learning allows you to extract valuable insights, make predictions, and automate decision-making from your data. Discover how KQL seamlessly integrates with machine learning to elevate your data analysis and modeling capabilities.

## The Power of Machine Learning

Machine learning empowers you to leverage your data for tasks such as:

- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast future trends and outcomes based on historical data.

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns and outliers in your data.

- **Recommendation Systems**: Offer personalized recommendations to users.

- **Classification**: Categorize data into predefined classes or categories.

- **Clustering**: Group similar data points together to find hidden structures.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyze and understand text data.

## Machine Learning Integration in KQL

Kusto Query Language provides built-in support for integrating with Azure Machine Learning services, enabling you to leverage machine learning models directly within your queries. Key components of machine learning integration in KQL include:

### **1. `ml.ingest` Function**

The `ml.ingest` function allows you to send data from your Kusto cluster to an Azure Machine Learning workspace for model training and evaluation.

```kql
datatable
| ml.ingest into <AzureMLWorkspace>.<Experiment>.<IngestionDataflow>
```

This query sends data from a datatable to an Azure Machine Learning workspace.

### **2. `ml.run` Function**

The `ml.run` function enables you to invoke machine learning models deployed in your Azure Machine Learning workspace and apply them to your data.

```kql
datatable
| ml.run <AzureMLWorkspace>.<ServiceName>.<RegisteredModel> with (columnMappings = <ColumnMappings>)
```

This query runs a registered machine learning model on your data.

### **3. Scoring and Predictions**

You can use machine learning models to score and make predictions on your data. This is invaluable for tasks like fraud detection, sentiment analysis, and demand forecasting.

### **4. Model Evaluation**

KQL allows you to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, making it easier to fine-tune and improve your models over time.

## Real-World Use Cases

Machine learning integration in KQL can be applied to a wide range of real-world use cases, such as:

- **Predictive Maintenance**: Predict when equipment or machinery is likely to fail based on sensor data.

- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Identify customers at risk of leaving a service or product.

- **Inventory Optimization**: Optimize inventory levels to meet demand while minimizing carrying costs.

- **Fraud Detection**: Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## Your Machine Learning Integration Journey

> Now that you've been introduced to machine learning integration in KQL, it's time to explore and experiment. Set up your Azure Machine Learning workspace, train models, deploy them, and integrate them into your KQL queries.

In the next module, we'll explore advanced data visualization techniques to effectively communicate your findings and insights. Get ready to visualize your data in [Module 3.3: Advanced Data Visualization](3.3_Advanced_Data_Visualization.md).
