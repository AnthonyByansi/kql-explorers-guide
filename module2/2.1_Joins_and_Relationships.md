# Module 2.1: Joins and Relationships in KQL

Welcome to Module 2.1 of the KQL Explorer's Guide! In this section, we'll dive into the fascinating world of joins and relationships in Kusto Query Language (KQL). Understanding how to combine data from multiple tables is a fundamental skill for data analysis and reporting. Let's explore how to do it effectively.

## Understanding Joins

A join operation combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. KQL supports several types of joins, including:

- **Inner Join**: Retrieves only the matching rows from both tables.

- **Left (Outer) Join**: Retrieves all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.

- **Right (Outer) Join**: Retrieves all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.

- **Full (Outer) Join**: Retrieves all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table.

## Join Syntax

The basic syntax for joining tables in KQL is as follows:

```kql
Table1
| join KindOfJoin (Table2) on KeyColumn
```

Here's an example of an inner join:

```kql
Orders
| join kind=inner (Customers) on CustomerID
```

This query joins the `Orders` table with the `Customers` table based on the `CustomerID` column.

## Combining Columns from Different Tables

After joining tables, you can select columns from both tables and create a single result set. For example:

```kql
Orders
| join kind=inner (Customers) on CustomerID
| project OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerName
```

This query selects the `OrderID` and `OrderDate` from the `Orders` table and the `CustomerName` from the `Customers` table.

## Handling NULL Values

When performing joins, you might encounter NULL values in columns. You can use the `coalesce()` function to handle NULLs gracefully. For example:

```kql
Orders
| join kind=leftouter (Customers) on CustomerID
| project OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerName = coalesce(CustomerName, "Unknown")
```

This query replaces NULL values in the `CustomerName` column with "Unknown."

## Understanding Relationships

In a database, relationships between tables are established using keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys. Understanding these relationships is crucial for designing effective queries. Common types of relationships include:

- **One-to-One (1:1)**: Each row in one table is related to one row in another table.

- **One-to-Many (1:N)**: Each row in one table can be related to multiple rows in another table.

- **Many-to-Many (N:N)**: Multiple rows in one table can be related to multiple rows in another table.

## Your Journey with Joins

> Now that you've grasped the basics of joins and relationships in KQL, it's time to apply your knowledge. Practice different types of joins and explore datasets with complex relationships to gain a deeper understanding.

In the next module, we'll delve into time-series analysis, a valuable skill for monitoring and tracking data changes over time. Get ready for advanced data analysis with KQL in [Module 2.2: Time-Series Analysis](2.2_Time-Series_Analysis.md).
