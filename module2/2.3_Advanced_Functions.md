# Module 2.3: Advanced Functions in KQL

Welcome to Module 2.3 of the KQL Explorer's Guide! In this module, we'll dive into advanced functions and techniques in Kusto Query Language (KQL). These functions enable you to perform complex data analysis, calculations, and manipulations. Let's explore how to take your data analysis skills to the next level.

## Leveraging Advanced Functions

As you become more proficient with KQL, you'll encounter scenarios that require advanced functions to derive insights and make informed decisions. This module introduces you to some powerful advanced functions and techniques:

### **1. `mv-expand` Function**

The `mv-expand` function is used to expand multivalue columns into individual rows, making it easier to analyze and aggregate data. For example, if you have a column containing an array of values, you can use `mv-expand` to create a row for each value in the array.

```kql
Events
| mv-expand Actions
```

This query expands the `Actions` column, creating a row for each action in the array.

### **2. `pivot` Function**

The `pivot` function allows you to transform your data by rotating it from a long format (many rows) to a wide format (fewer rows, more columns). This can be especially useful for summarizing data and creating custom views.

```kql
Sales
| pivot ProductName, sum(SalesAmount) as TotalSales
```

This query pivots the data to show total sales for each product.

### **3. `serialize` and `deserialize` Functions**

The `serialize` function converts data into a binary format for efficient storage and transmission. Conversely, the `deserialize` function converts serialized data back into its original format.

These functions are valuable when dealing with binary data, such as telemetry or logs.

### **4. `hierarchical_clustering` Function**

KQL includes advanced machine learning functions like `hierarchical_clustering`, which allows you to perform hierarchical clustering analysis on your data. This can help you discover patterns and relationships within your datasets.

```kql
Data
| summarize features = pack_array(Feature1, Feature2, Feature3)
| evaluate hierarchical_clustering(features)
```

This query performs hierarchical clustering on a set of features.

## Custom Functions

KQL allows you to define your custom functions to encapsulate complex logic and calculations. This can enhance code readability and reusability. Custom functions are particularly useful when you have repetitive tasks or need to perform domain-specific calculations.

```kql
let calculate_discount = (originalPrice: real) {
    let discountRate = 0.2; // 20% discount
    let discountedPrice = originalPrice * (1 - discountRate);
    discountedPrice
};
Sales
| extend DiscountedPrice = calculate_discount(Price)
```

In this example, we define a custom function `calculate_discount` to calculate discounted prices for sales.

## Time-Series Analysis Revisited

You can apply the advanced functions introduced in this module to enhance your time-series analysis capabilities. For instance, you can pivot and analyze time-series data, use custom functions for anomaly detection, or apply machine learning functions for trend analysis.

## Your Journey with Advanced Functions

> Now that you've learned about advanced functions in KQL, it's time to practice and experiment. Explore your own datasets, identify scenarios where advanced functions can provide insights, and refine your data analysis skills.

In the next module, we'll explore geospatial queries, allowing you to analyze data based on location and geography. Get ready to dive into spatial data analysis in [Module 2.4: Geospatial Queries](2.4_Geospatial_Queries.md).
