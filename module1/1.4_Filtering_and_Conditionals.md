In Module 1.3, we explored the basics of data exploration with Kusto Query Language (KQL). Now, it's time to deepen our understanding by delving into filtering and conditionals. Filtering allows us to narrow down our dataset to specific subsets of interest, while conditionals enable us to add dynamic logic to our queries. Let's get started!

## Basic Filtering with WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause in KQL is a powerful tool for filtering rows in your data based on specified conditions. It helps you focus on the data that matters most for your analysis. Here's a quick recap of the `WHERE` clause syntax:

```kql
TableName
| where Condition
```

For example, to retrieve sales data only for products with a sales amount greater than $1,000:

```kql
Sales
| where SalesAmount > 1000
```

This query filters rows where the `SalesAmount` is greater than $1,000.

## Logical Operators

KQL supports various logical operators to create complex conditions:

- `AND`: Allows you to combine multiple conditions, ensuring all conditions must be true for a row to be included in the result set.

- `OR`: Provides flexibility by selecting rows that meet at least one of the specified conditions.

- `NOT`: Negates a condition, selecting rows that do not meet the specified criteria.

Here's an example of using logical operators to filter data:

```kql
Sales
| where SalesAmount > 1000 and (ProductName == "ProductX" or ProductName == "ProductY")
```

This query selects rows where the `SalesAmount` is greater than $1,000, and the `ProductName` is either "ProductX" or "ProductY."

## Conditional Columns

In KQL, you can create new columns with conditional values using the `case()` function. This function allows you to define conditions and assign values based on those conditions. Here's an example:

```kql
Sales
| extend SalesCategory = case(
    SalesAmount > 1000, "High",
    SalesAmount > 500, "Medium",
    true, "Low")
```

In this query, we create a new column `SalesCategory` based on the sales amount, categorizing it as "High," "Medium," or "Low."

## Handling NULL Values

Handling NULL values is crucial in data analysis. KQL provides the `isnull()` and `isnotnull()` functions to check for NULL values in your data. For example:

```kql
Sales
| where isnull(Discount)
```

This query selects rows where the `Discount` column is NULL.

## Regular Expressions

KQL supports regular expressions for advanced string pattern matching. You can use the `matches regex` operator to filter rows based on regex patterns:

```kql
Logs
| where Message matches regex @"(error|exception)"
```

This query selects rows where the `Message` column contains either "error" or "exception."

## Your Filtering and Conditional Journey

>  Now that you've learned the essentials of filtering and conditionals in KQL, it's time to practice and experiment with your own queries. Refine your skills by exploring different datasets and scenarios.

In the next module, we'll venture into more advanced topics, including joins and relationships. Get ready for a deeper dive into data analysis with KQL in [Module 2.1: Joins and Relationships](2.1_Joins_and_Relationships.md).
