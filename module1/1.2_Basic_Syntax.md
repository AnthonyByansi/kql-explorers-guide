# Module 1: Introduction to KQL

## 1.2 Basic Syntax in Kusto Query Language (KQL)

In the previous section, you got a glimpse of Kusto Query Language (KQL) and wrote your first basic query. In this module, we will dive deeper into the fundamental elements of KQL syntax, helping you become more proficient in crafting queries for data analysis.

### Query Structure

KQL queries consist of a series of operations applied to data tables. Let's break down the basic structure of a KQL query:

```kql
TableName
| Operation1
| Operation2
| ...
```

- `TableName`: The name of the table you're querying. It is essential to specify the source of your data.
- `OperationX`: Each line represents an operation that you want to perform on the data. These can include `filtering`, `aggregation`, `sorting`, and more.

#### `project`: Selecting Columns

The `project` operator is used to choose specific columns from the data table. It allows you to shape the output of your query by selecting only the columns you need.

```kql
Orders
| project OrderID, CustomerName, TotalAmount
```

#### `where`: Filtering Rows

The `where` operator is used to filter rows based on conditions. You can apply logical and comparison operators to narrow down your dataset.

```kql
Sales
| where Quantity > 10 and TotalPrice >= 100
```

#### `summarize`: Aggregating Data

The `summarize` operator is used for data aggregation. You can calculate statistics like counts, sums, averages, and more.

```kql
WebLogs
| summarize PageViews = count(), AvgResponseTime = avg(ResponseTime)
```

#### `order by`: Sorting Results

The `order by` operator allows you to sort your query results based on one or more columns, either in ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`) order.

```kql
Products
| order by Price desc
```

### Functions and Operators

KQL offers a wide range of functions and operators to manipulate and analyze data. Some commonly used functions include:

- `count()`: Counts the number of rows.
- `sum()`: Calculates the sum of a numeric column.
- `avg()`: Computes the average of a numeric column.
- `min()` and `max()`: Find the minimum and maximum values in a column.
- `datetime()`: Converts a string to a datetime object.
- `toupper()` and `tolower()`: Changes text to uppercase or lowercase.
- `contains()`: Checks if a string contains a specific substring.

Operators include logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), and arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).

### Practice Your Skills

To reinforce your understanding of KQL syntax, try writing queries that perform the following tasks:

1. Select only the `ProductName` and `Price` columns from the `Products` table.
2. Filter the `CustomerData` table to include only rows where `Age` is greater than or equal to 30.
3. Calculate the total sales revenue (`TotalPrice`) for the `Sales` table.
4. Sort the `ServerLogs` table by the `Timestamp` column in descending order.

### Next Steps

Now that you have a solid grasp of KQL's basic syntax, you are ready to explore more advanced topics in the upcoming modules. In [Module 1.3 - Data Exploration](1.3_Data_Exploration.md), we will dive into techniques for exploring and summarizing data effectively using KQL.

Keep practicing and experimenting with queries to strengthen your KQL skills. Happy querying!
