## About KQL Explorer's Guide

The KQL Explorer's Guide is a community-driven project aimed at providing a structured and in-depth learning experience for Kusto Query Language (KQL). KQL is a powerful query language used primarily in Azure services like Azure Data Explorer for data analysis, monitoring, and more. This guide covers everything from basic syntax to advanced topics, empowering you to harness the full potential of KQL in your data-driven projects.

## Getting Started

To start learning and exploring KQL, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnthonyByansi/kql-explorers-guide.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Documentation:** The core documentation is located in the `docs/` directory. Start with the [Introduction to KQL](docs/module1/1.1_Getting_Started.md) to get an overview of the language and its basic syntax.

3. **Explore Modules:** Each module in this guide covers specific aspects of KQL. Navigate through the modules in sequential order to build your knowledge progressively.

4. **Practice Exercises:** Challenge yourself with hands-on exercises in the `exercises/` directory to reinforce your learning.

5. **Contribute:** If you have valuable insights or want to improve this guide, consider contributing. See our [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
